# CS 325 Environment

This code automatically sets up the environment for CS 325 for Lisp and Mac OS users using [nix](https://nixos.org/), a purely functional package manager with an emphasis on reproducibility. Whether you use nix for everything already or you simply want to try something new and interesting, these instructions are for you. Here are the three steps:

1. Install `nix` onto your machine:

   curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh

Check [the official documentation](https://nixos.org/download.html) for further instructions.

2. Clone this repository onto your machine and `cd` into it.

3. Run:

   nix-shell

Tada! You're done. Everything is now set up.
